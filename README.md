## Project Breakdown
The first half of this course was done in C and the second half of the course was done in C++. Homeworks 1-4 were done in C and Homeworks 5-8 and both extra credit
assignments were done in C++. Every project had different goals which are as follows:

### Homework 1
This project is just a basic "Hello World" program. The main goal of this project was to set up our ix-dev accounts at the University of Oregon so we
could complete later projects easier.

### Homework 2
The main purpose of this project was to focus on how to open, close, and write to files as well as how to allocate memory without any leaks.

### Homework 3
There were two big parts to this project:
1. Convert from coordinate (COO) format to compressed sparse row (CSR) format
2. Sparse matrix vector (SpMV) multiplication

### Homework 4
This project was all about breadth first search (BFS). We implemented a BFS algorithm using a linked list and also using SpMV.

### Homework 5
This project was an introduction to object oriented programming in C++. We had to read a file and deliver the correct response (normal, happy, or angry) based on
what the line said in the file.

### Homework 6
The overarching focus to this project was to teach us about inheritance in C++. We wrote 5 different ways to encrypt a message that all built off of the method
previous to it. The 5 ways were:
1. Substitution Cipher
2. Caesar Cipher
3. ROT13 Cipher
4. Running Key Cipher
5. Vigenere Cipher

### Homework 7
In this assignment we created a binary search tree (BST) and a database to store student information that uses the BST and inheritance.

### Homework 8
The final required assignment in this class had us implement a quick sort method in two ways:
1. A normal quick sort algorithm
2. A parallelized quick sort algorithm using #pragma

### Extra Credit 1
The first extra credit had us parallelize the SpMV we did in homework 3. This was as simple as adding two #pragma statements.

### Extra Credit 2
The second extra credit had us create a red-black tree in C++ from scratch.
